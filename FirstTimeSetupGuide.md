### Setting up VR
A minimum Play Space of 2.5m wide and 4.5m long is recommended for one machine, in addition to space for the computer, monitor, etc.<br>

> This width is for one rowing machine,<br>
> Add 1.5m to the width for every additional rowing machine<br>

Setup the BaseStations (of wich you probably have two) in opposite corners in the room. Place them as high as you can get them, looking down on the Play Space, so that there is line of sight to at least one of the stations from any point in the Space.<br>

### Setting up the RP3
Place the RP3 in the middle of your playspace, it is recommended to have the machine side facing the computers so the connecting cable doesnt tangle.<br>

### Setting up the trackers
Place the trackers on the RP3
<br>TODO: make placement a bit more descriptive, where does each tracker need to be placed.<br>
> **Note**<br>
> An adapter has been designer for the tundra tracker to attach it to the handle easier. The model to 3D print can be found [here](link to 3d model)
